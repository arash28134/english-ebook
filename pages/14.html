        <p class="sans desc">There is a special type of argument, called a flag. Flags are letters/words prefixed with a
            dash. They do not give the command data, like which file to remove. But rather, define options. Flags are
            predefined, and you can get a list of all available flags for a command in its documentation. For example,
            the <i>rm</i> command has a flag <i>-i</i> which will make it so it will ask you to make sure you want to
            delete a file, for every file it tries to delete. Flags can be given to commands just like arguments,
            separated by space. Flags are usually a letter prefixed with a single dash, eg. "-i" pr, a word
            prefixed by 2 dashes, eg. "--interactive". Most of the time there is a shorthand flag like "-i" and a long
            descriptive one like "--interactive", however, they both do the same thing. Flags also sometimes get a
            value. For example, the <i>nano</i> command, which is a CLI text editor, has a flag for the
            backup file location, "--backupdir" or "-C" for short. They both get a value. For example, to give them the
            "/home/mahan/config/nano" directory, you can either do "nano -C /home/mahan/config/nano file_to_edit.txt" or "nano --backupdir=/home/mahan/config/nano file_to_edit.txt". Notice that the
            shorthand flag's value is right in front of the flag, separated by a space, but the long flag has its value
            in front of it after an equal mark. That's usually the case, however, none of these are rules, so you might
            find commands that behave differently. For example, the <i>find</i> command takes a "-name" argument.
            Although it's a long word, neither does it have double dashes, nor it gets the value by equal mark, but it
            behaves just like a shorthand flag, eg. "find -name file.txt".</p>
