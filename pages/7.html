        <h2 class="title">D. Unix, and the history of Linux</h2>
        <p class="sans desc">Unix is an OS developed at 1971 by AT&amp;T by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
            Unix was designed for large corporations and instituations and was very limited. So, around the same time,
            another project called <i>MINIX</i> started developing. MINIX was a minial Unix-like OS designed for
            educational purposes. However, Linus Torvalds, the original developer of Linux, was not happy with MINIX's
            licensing, since it wasn't very flexible. Also, he was interested a lot in OS development, so, he started
            developing another Unix-like OS, just for fun and free time. Later on, he named the project <i>Linux</i>,
            which stands for "Linus's Unix". Linux was completely open-source, meaning anyone could use, view, comment
            on, and modify the project freely. As such, it started gaining popularity and a lot of developers
            contributed to it. Eventually, the project grew big, and become the best free, liberate, open-source kernel
            in the world. People loved Linux's freedom. The fact that they could modify the product to suit their own
            need, and also be able to make sure there is no bad activity like spying from the developers by viewing the
            source code made people love Linux.</p>
