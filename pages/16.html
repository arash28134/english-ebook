        <h2 class="title">M. Linux filesystem structure</h2>
        <p class="sans desc">
            Linux file system is very different from Windows but more similar to Mac since Mac is also a Unix-like OS.
            There is no C:\ Drive in Linux. But rather, the partition (drive) is called the "root" partition, and can be
            accessed by the address "/". Most OS-related files rely somewhere in the root folder. Almost
            everything you do in your machine resides in the root folder. You can go to the root folder in the terminal
            with "cd /" and then list all of its content (even hidden ones with "-a" flag) with "ls -a"
            Let's discuss some standard directories in Unix-like systems.
        </p>
        <ul class="comp-list sans">
            <li>"." and "..": These are in all directories. They are not actual folders, but rather some links. "."
                means the current folder. For example, if you are in the folder "/etc/default", running "nano ./grub"
                will be translated to "nano /etc/default/grub". Similarily, ".." represents the parent folder. eg. if
                you are in "/usr/share/applications", ".." will point to the "/usr/share" folder, ie. "nano
                ../docs/xorg/index.html" will be translated to "nano /usr/share/docs/xorg/index.html"</li>
            <br />
            <li>bin: Command and app binary files. Remember, commands are just applications, and applications are just
                instruction files!</li>
            <br />
            <li>dev: In Linux, every device is a file. The file does not actually exist in the disk, but it can be used
                to access devices, ie. writing to the printer's "device file" located somewhere in "/dev" will lead to
                the pritner operating.</li>
            <br />
            <li>boot: Boot related files. Grub bootloader readonly config and binary files</li>
            <br />
            <li>etc: Program Configuration files. Grub configuration files can be found at "/etc/default/grub"</li>
            <br />
            <li>home: User home folders reside in "/home/username". Home folder contains user-related files. This is the
                place where you should use to stoer personal data and is the only place where your regular user has
                write/modify level permissions. The home folder of the current logged in user can be accessed using "~".
                Eg. "~/Donwloads" will be translated to "/home/username/Downloads"</li>
            <br />
            <li>usr: The global user folder. Configuration files for apps that the user - and not the system - uses
                residehere. However, they are global. Meaning the app will use that config file for all user.s For local
                user configuration, use the home folder. Eg. instead of "/usr/local/applications", you can view user
                specific app files in "~/.local/applications". Note that this is also not a standard, and the app should
                also support user specific configuration</li>
            <br />
            <li>/usr/bin: Binaries that are used byt the user and not the system. Most command binary files can be found
                in here.</li>
            <br />
            <li>lib: Application library files</li>
            <br />
            <li> /usr/lib: User-side application library files</li>
            <br />
            <li>tmp: Temporary files folder. Everything in there will be deleted on reboot</li>
            <br />
            <li>var: Files that change frequently should be placed here. Stands for variable.</li>
            <br />
            <li>proc: Similar to dev, not an actual folder, but a way to access processes. You don't need to worry about
                anything in there.</li>
            <br />
            <li>mnt: Other disk mount locations. Mounting is a way to assing an address to a parition (drive). Your root
                drive is mounted at "/". Other drives should be mounted as folders in /mnt. It's not a rule, but it's a
                good practice to mount paritions in mnt folder. You can use "mnt" command to mount paritions, however,
                most systems will do it automatically.</li>
            <br />
            <li>media: Usually, automatically mouted drives are mounted in here instead of mnt.</li>
            <br />
            <li>opt: Installation location of add-on applications. If you are installing an app manually by copying its
                files, install it in here.</li>
            <br />
            <li> Note that in Linux everything is a file. Processes are files. Devices are files. The CPU is a file.
                However, they are not actual files. They are virtual. They show up as a file, but they don't take any
                space. They cannot be deleted. You cannot create a device file, since the kernel manages them. Trying to
                read/write to device files results in kernel calls.</li>
        </ul>
