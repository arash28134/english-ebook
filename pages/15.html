        <h2 class="title">L. Useful Linux Commands</h2>
        <p class="sans desc">
            Some useful Linux commands are:
        </p>
        <ul class="sans comp-list">
            <li>man: The manual command, or man, for short, is a command to view the manual for other commands. For example, "man find" will give you all the possible flags, arguments, and any information about that command.</li>
            <br />
            <li>cd: cd, stands for Change Directory. You can navigate folders with it. For example, to open the "images" folder, you can do "cd images"</li>
            <br />
            <li>ls: List the content of this directory (folder). You can use cd to enter your desired folder and list its content using ls</li>
            <br />
            <li>mkdir/rmdir: Make a new directory, remove a directory, eg. "mkdir new_folder" and "rmdir new_folder"</li>
            <br />
            <li>rm: Remove files/folders. To remove a non-empty folder, use rm with "-r" flag instead of "rmdir" command. eg. "rm -r new_folder_not_empty"</li>
            <br />
            <li>touch: Create a new empty file, eg. "touch note.txt"</li>
            <br />
            <li>nano: An easy text editor, eg. "nano note.txt"</li>
            <br />
            <li>clear: Clear the messy terminal</li>
            <br />
            <li>find: Search for files and folders.</li>
            <br />
            <li>sudo: Run a command as the super user (root user). Sometimes your regular user does not have enough permissions to do some things. For example, the command "rm /etc/default/grub" will give you Permission Denied error, since you do not have enough permissions to delete the file /etc/default/grub. You can use "sudo" to run a command as root, which has all the permissions maxed out. Similar to Windows's "run as adiminitrator". eg. "sudo rm /etc/default/grub"</li>
        </ul>
