        <p class="sans desc">
            The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, the original developer of Unix, is a set of cultural norms
            and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It says that every software should
            do one thing, and do it very well. It means that instead of writing all-in-one software, make
            each part as separate software, and assemble them. So that, each piece can be individually reused
            in another project. The Linux community and software mostly follow the Unix philosophy, that's why there are
            lots of software for a simple job, because each, do one piece of the entire work. Each software is like a
            Lego set. You can mix them to do whatever you want.
