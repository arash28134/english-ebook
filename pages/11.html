            Linux is a very different OS from Windows and Mac. Linux gives you freedom, to make it how you like it, so
            of course, you can make it look like Windows or Mac, but that's not the preferred way of using Linux. The
            best way to become a Linux user is to unlearn your previous OS and try to completely learn new concepts.
            For example, for installing software on Linux, you don't need to go to a website and download it from there.
            And then run the downloaded file to install it. In Linux-based OS, there is a software called package
            manager. Linux OS has a package repository. A package repository is a very large collection of software,
            that the package manager can install. Software in there is verified to run stable and secure. There is no
            malware in there, so you don't need to check anything. Also, there is no download and install process
            involved. What you need to do is just enter a single command, or use a graphical package manager, similar to
            Google Play Store, to download, unpack, and install it for you automatically with one click. It will also
            auto-update it and removing the software is as easy as installing it. In Linux, the terminal is your friend.
            We'll discuss the terminal later, but you need to change your mind and think of it as an actual easier way
            to do stuff, rather than a hard way that only nerds use. Also, in Linux, things are more community-oriented,
            so for example for support, instead of calling a corporation on Microsoft, you can just ask on online
            forums, and the community will answer you. So, remember, unlearn everything you know, and learn the Linux
            ways, without any bias towards certain things like the terminal.
