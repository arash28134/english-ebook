        <p class="sans desc">So, clever programmers have solved that problem, by creating a piece of code called
            Operating System. An Operating System is basically a bridge between your hardware and apps. It contains all
            the repeatitive code so no other programmer needs to
            write them anymore. For example, instead of writing the code to allocate memory for every single memory
            brand out there, a programmer can just tell the OS to magically "allocate memory" for it without knowing how
            it's done. These codes are called <b>System Libraries</b></p>
