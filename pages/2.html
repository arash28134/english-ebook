        <p class="sans desc">Operating system is the core of your system. Any computer has a CPU, and that CPU can
            execute code. However, programmers need to write different codes for different machines, based on their
            hardware, eg. CPU architecture, brand, etc. So, writing
            a simple app like a calculator to run on all sorts of different hardwares would be a very tedious thing to
            do, not to mention many steps would be needed in all applications, for example initializing CPU into it's
            operating mode, allocating
            ram, etc.</p>
