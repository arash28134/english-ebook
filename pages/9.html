        <p class="sans desc">
            The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, the original developer of Unix, is a set of cultural norms
            and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It says that every software should
            do one thing, and do it very good. It basically means that instead of writing all-in-one softwares, make
            each part as a seperate software, and assemble them together. So that, each piece can be individually reused
            in another project. The Linux community and softwares mostly follow the Unix philosphy, that's why there are
            lots of software for a simple work, because each, do one piece of the entire work. Each software is like a
            Lego set. You can mix them with each other to do whatever you want.
