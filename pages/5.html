        <p class="sans desc">So far, we have discussed the reason why Operating Systems were made, but, we have only covered 2 parts: System Libraries and Device Drivers. An OS is made of these parts:</p>
        <ul class="comp-list sans">
            <li>System Libraries: The way for developers to use the OS's functionality</li>
            <br />
            <li>Device Drivers: How an OS talks to real hardware</li>
            <br />
            <li>Software: This includes basic apps eg. calculator, notepad, etc. and system apps, like your graphical desktop environment, mouse renderer, audio servers, display servers, etc.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Kernel: The heart of the OS. The actual thing that handles Library calls, interacts with drivers and runs the OS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="sans desc">With all these main components and many more, the OS becomes fully functional and usable</p>
