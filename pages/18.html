        <h2 class="title">Linux vs Windows</h2>
        <p class="sans desc">
            Other than Linux being open source, and giving you freedom, privacy, and security, here are some other
            advantages:
        </p>
        <ul class="comp-list sans">
            <li>Linux is faster and more lightweight: Linux by design uses fewer resources than Windows. Things like
                crashes and freezing happen very very rare in Linux, even on old computers. The freedom Linux gives you
                makes it so you can install a bare minimum OS if your system can't handle the big bloated Windows.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Linux has fewer security issues: Linux is open-source, so with thousands of people looking at the source
                code, bugs and security vulnerabilities are usually discovered very fast, also, since Linux is used by
                fewer people than Windows, malware developers don't build their malware for Linux, just because how fewer
                people will get infected by it. So, Linux usually has less malware</li>
            <br />
            <li>Linux is customizable: You can make your system however you like it. Besides modifying code, most Linux
                apps also have a broad range of settings you can tweak, without modifying the code. That is usually not
                the case in Windows</li>
            <br />
            <li>Jobs are easier: Installing software is easier, eg. on ubuntu, you can install firefox by just typing
                "sudo apt install firefox" in the terminal. However, in Windows, you need to download the installer and
                install it through the tedious process. Also, deleting all png files in Linux can be done by "rm *.png"
                whereas in Windows, you need to manually select all. You just need to learn, then it becomes easy.</li>
        </ul>
