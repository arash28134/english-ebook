        <p class="sans desc">
            Free Open-Source Software, or FOSS for short is a type of software who provides freedom to the users. It
            does that by being open-source. So the users can modify the software if they wish. You may have heard Linux
            and related software called a lot by this name, and might've always thought they call it free because it's
            free in terms of money. But, that's not actually the case. Free software, means free in terms of freedom and
            liberty. The main point of the Linux world is user freedom. GNU/Linux developers believe that the user
            should have control on their software. The user should be able to clearly see what the software is doing,
            and also modify it if they are not happy with it. Also, the user can contribute to the project, meaning they
            can share their desired changes with others. That's why Linux is so robust and reliable compared to Windows.
            We'll talk about Linux performance in a later chapter. Linux has recieved a lot of contributions during it's
            lifetime. Infact, currently it has more than 12,000 active contributors to the kernel code itself only. In
            many cases, the enthusiast user can fix any bug they see quickly and share the changes, instead of talking
            to the developers and convincing them about the bug and then them trying to reproduce the buy in order to
            fix it, which is usually the process with proprietary, closed-source, non-free software.
            In the GNU/Linux world, it's always a better idea to use an open-source alternative to a closed source software. For instance, instead of Adobe Photoshop, you can use GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program. Or, instead of Microsoft Office, you can use LibreOffice, the open-source Office suit based on the OpenOffice project.
