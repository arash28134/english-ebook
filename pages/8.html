        <h2 class="title">E. The GNU project</h2>
        <p class="sans desc">
            Unix was very limited. It didn't have much software available for it and many of them were non-free closed-source. The GNU project, originally started by Richard Stallman, is a software suite aimed to provide a free open-source software package for the Unix OS. GNU is the foundation of FOSS (free open-source software), and the Linux kernel, inspired from the GNU project, is licensed under the GNU General Public License, or GPL for short. Remember that Linux is only the kernel and drivers? GNU is the complete software suite containing all the other things.
            These include:
        </p>
        <ul class="comp-list sans">
            <li>GNU Corelibs: The GNU system libraries.</li>
            <br />
            <li>GNU BASH: The main terminal interface for Linux based OS.</li>
            <br />
            <li>GNU GRUB: The Linux Grand Unifed Bootloader</li>
            <br />
            <li>GIMP: The GNU's Image Manipulation Program</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="sans desc">And many more. With the help of the GNU project, Linux became a fully usable complete OS. That's why technically, you should refer to Linux-based OS like GNU/Linux, or GNU + Linux. Even to this day, most of the GNU software is still in active development and receiving constant updates.</p>
